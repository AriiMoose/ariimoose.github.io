title: New Year, Same Project
---

Ayyy, it's 2017! And with that, time for the first update of the new year!

### Game Dev Update

I got the UI functioning, and fixed two bugs; one where players would receive damage when stomping (instead of when being stomped), and another where a player would lose all their lives when stomped instead of losing just one. You can check out the update [over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfAk3AIZfqY)

I've also started work on the grappling hook tutorial. I most likely won't have the tutorial finished until after the Two Week Challenge for Grapple Guys is done, but at the very least I can get stuff prepped.

What's next for Grapple Guys? Well, now I just need to design the playtest level, and create the remaining art assets! This week I'm going to try and get the art assets for the main menu buttos done, then maybe tackle doing a large background piece. I'm leaving the level design until closer to the end. The current set up can be functional as a test level once it's given a fresh coat of paint.

### Other Work

Wrote some job applications, and gave my LinkedIn/Resume a massive facelift. That alone took a couple days because I'm terrified about making mistakes on that stuff.

The website has hit a bit of a wall. On one hand, I managed to get a super important feature working after over a month of struggling with it. On the other hand, trying to figure out the best way to store the data from said feature is preventing me from integrating it in any meaningful way.

### Free Time (Procrastination)

Tried out Final Fantasy XIV, which was super fun! Definitely tempted to pick that up at some stage, possibly after the next expansion. I've also been no-lifing Dark Souls 3 after finally getting my hands on it. I've also been playing a ton of the Eternal Open Beta.

Anyway, that's it for this week. For more regular updates you can find me on [Twitter](twitter.com/ariimoose). Alternatively if you just want Grapple Guys/Two Week Challenge content I try to post regular updates to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-LX3iknXZp5djP7SACbGHA1dGJvhFg-x). In the mean time, stay tuned for next week where I'll hopefully have some interesting updates to share with you guys!
