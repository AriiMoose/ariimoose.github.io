title: Making Progress
---

After a wild and busy Christmas period I'm back to blogging and making progress!

### Game Dev Update
The core stuff for Grapple Guys is done! Still have to fix that bug (thanks procrastination!) but I've got most of the UI functional. I'm crazy excited to jump back into doing some pixel art for the game. Especially the background for the level and the UI buttons.

Also, I made a video recap of the project! [In this video](https://youtu.be/iYUz6-d7qNk) I expalin the project and show off what I've done so far. I'm hoping to make more of these as I continue to add stuff to the project. Check it out and let me know what you think!

### Other Work
After struggling with some third-party Django libraries I'm proud to say my other development project is doing awesome! Over the past couple months I've been working with Travis Woo, a well-known Magic The Gathering personality, to create a MTG deck building website. Once I tie up some loose ends with how user accounts work & test it out we'll be good to go! We're starting small, but we've got some pretty big plans in store for this website.

I'm incredibly proud of this project. It's been an awesome learning experience, and has huge long-term potential.

### Free Time (Procrastination)
Managed to do a lot of fun stuff over the holiday season, which was full of surprises. I've taken advantage of the current Steam Winter Sale (or rather, it has taken advantage of me), finished Dishonoured (a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be), and watched The Accountant & Rogue One. Rogue One was awesome, and The Accountant caught me off guard completely. I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did.

Stay tuned for next week where I'll hopefully have more stuff to show off!
