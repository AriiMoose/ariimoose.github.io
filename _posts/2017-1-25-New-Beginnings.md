Almost forgot to do this today thanks to a busy week, but I managed to remember!

### Game Dev Update

Making awesome progress on my entry for [#MAKEITSUPERHOT](moddb.com/games/superhot/makeitsuperhot) is coming along nicely! Some parts of it were a lot less tricky than I imagined they would be, while some other parts have been a lot more awkward that I ever thought they would be. Such is game development. Regardless of the outcome of this I'm pretty happy with the project overall because it's seriously upped my game dev skills, especially as far as engineering is concerned. Should be ready to show something off soon!

For Grapple Guys, not much progress has been made unfortunately. I haven't got a chance to playtest it with a bunch of people, but I'm probably still going to release it by the end of the week anyway. Also thanks to a bunch of other stuff going on right now, I haven't got a chance to make a new video update for Grapple Guys.

### Other Work

I've been busy hustling and bustling trying to get a bunch of other stuff done. Website is still not up due to more logistical issues, but I've been doing what I can to make the launch as smooth as possible

### Free Time (Procrastination)

Saw Your Name. Exceeded my expectations like crazy! Loved it! Also played a ton of new latest Hitman. Also a wonderful experience! The reply value is awesome.

Anyway, that's it for this week. For more regular updates you can find me on [Twitter](twitter.com/ariimoose). Alternatively if you just want Grapple Guys/Two Week Challenge content I try to post regular updates to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/AriiMoose). I'm also thinking of branching out, and making more post that aren't related to my own game dev adventures. Maybe some tabletop RPG content, or musings on game development as a whole. In the mean time, stay tuned for next week where I'll hopefully have some interesting updates to share with you guys!
