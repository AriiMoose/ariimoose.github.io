Much to my chagrin I managed to miss a few weeks of updates as a result of family business! Between Christmas prep, a wedding, and having relative visit I haven't had much time to work on personal projects, or maintain this blog.

### Game Dev Update
Managed to get a tiny bit of work done (fingers crossed for the recap video this week). I got collision working, along with player death, life deduction on hit and all that good stuff. There's a minor bug involving the attacking player taking damage as well as the defending player but that can be fixed!

My next step is to get a menu working so that the number of players can be selected, then have them loaded in accordingly. That should help everything else fall into place. Last I checked we're on Day 5 of 14, so there's plenty of time left! Assuming I haven't miscounted the days.

### Other Work
Been revamping the website to make it look nice before the soft launch. All the core features are implemented, it's just a matter of getting some essential quality of life features in. Once that's done we're good to go!

### Free Time (Procrastination)
Between the wedding and being with family I've been playing Mirror's Edge: Catalyst (a little disappointing) & Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen (better than expected). I've desperately been sorting out my backlog of shows to watch once Jojo's Bizarre Adventure ends this month. Also watched this great interview with Suda51 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfXnyn1D1Uk) and have been listening to this mixtape nonstop (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rehF0Df2DIc). The name drew me in because I thought it was hilarious, but it turned out to be really interesting to listen to. Oh, and I also tried going back to charcoal drawing. I still suck but it's fun.
