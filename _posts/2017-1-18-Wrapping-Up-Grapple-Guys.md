title: Wrapping Up Grapple Guys
---

End of the line for Grapple Guys & some exciting updates!

### Game Dev Update

Loads of exciting stuff happening here! There's only a couple days left on my Two Week Challenge for Grapple Guys (two or three, kind of lost track). The game is functional, and I re-designed the test level! All that's left now is the background image. Not entirely happy with the new version of the test level, but it's certainly an improvement. Since I have some extra time left I'm going to test the game out with some friends, and hopefully incorporate that feedback.

This should be on https://itch.io/ in the coming week as a Pay-What-You-Want title. I'm also going to be uploading a recap of the past couple days to my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/AriiMoose). Additionally, I'm going to work on writing a post-mortem of the experience.

In other news, I'm entering the [Make it SUPERHOT](http://www.moddb.com/games/superhot/makeitsuperhot) competition! This was a lovely little coincidence as the next project for the Two Week Challenge was inspired by SUPERHOT. So, instead of a Two Week Challenge it's becoming a 36 Day Challenge! I'm really excited to try out a longer development cycle for a solo project.

The great thing about this competition is that it's already forced me to rethink/redesign multiple elements of my original concept. And they're all solid improvements! Constraints definitely inspire creativity. The only downside to this is I'll have to postpone the grappling hook tutorial I had planned.

### Other Work

Website is ready, just looking at options for hosting & deploying it. I've never had to (properly) deploy a web app so I'm a bit nervous! Desperately checking, and double-checking, that I've done everything correctly. Once myself and Travis work on some logistical snags we'll be firing it up.

### Free Time (Procrastination)

Managed to get my tabletop RPG group (semi)reunited this week. A long-awaited Pathfinder session I've been planning was meant to go ahead but we had some last-minute cancellations. While frustrating, it gave me the opportunity to test out Fragged Empire, a sci-fi RPG I've been excited to run for some time. Thanks to some pre-gens and an intro adventure we had a wonderful space-ferring time which ended in mutiny and the party scuttling their space ship to stop a deadly virus from being released into the galaxy. Definitely not the ending I expected.

Anyway, that's it for this week. For more regular updates you can find me on [Twitter](twitter.com/ariimoose). Alternatively if you just want Grapple Guys/Two Week Challenge content I try to post regular updates to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/AriiMoose). I'm also thinking of branching out, and making more post that aren't related to my own game dev adventures. Maybe some tabletop RPG content, or musings on game development as a whole. In the mean time, stay tuned for next week where I'll hopefully have some interesting updates to share with you guys!
