Since I started this blog the other day I haven't gotten a significant amount of work done in the mean time, so this post will be pretty short. But in the spirit of consistency we're going to go ahead with it anyway!

### Game Dev Update
So, I haven't got any work done on Grapple Guys. But, I've been keeping on top of things! I've applied to three different game dev positions, with another two applications waiting to be written.

### Other Work
The web dev project I've been working on has been coming along nicely, and is almost ready to show the world. It's almost functional, then I just have to give it a fresh coat of paint and make it look beautiful

### Free Time (Procrastination)
This week I've been watching a ton of Bojack Horseman, Hunter x Hunter, and keeping on top of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
I've listened to Dumbfoundead and A Tribe Called Quest's new albums non-stop, and I've had a tough time expressing self-control thanks to Titanfall 2's addictive multiplayer.
Oh, I also saw Lucky Chops live which was pretty sweet.

All in all, pretty good stuff.
