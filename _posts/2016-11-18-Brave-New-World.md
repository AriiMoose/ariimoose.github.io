title: Brave New World
---

This officially marks the first step on my journy to share all my gamedev experiences (for better, or for worse) with the world! After a year of working with a small independent team I have decided that working on small personal projects is the best way for me to enhance my dev skills.

The first project in the works (currently called Grapple Guys) is coming along nicely! The plan is to develop it in 14 days (currently on day 6), then release it for free (with the options of modest donations) to get feedback and some kind of reputation! I'll be using this blog to do weekly reviews of my work, along with major updates to my portfolio. Or even to throw around ideas! I'm also going to supplement this blog with (hopefully) daily recaps of my development work, both to help myself and hopefully others.

Time to get to work!
