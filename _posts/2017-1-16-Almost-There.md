After some technical issues I'm back! Better late than never, I guess.

###Game Dev Update

Not a lot of game dev was done this week. Made pixel art for the UI, simultaneously created and fixed a bug (hooray), and got started on the background. Large scale pixel art is hard. You can find all the juicy details [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdLgGl4PgzE&t=4s)

That's it. Not too much interesting on the game dev front this week, unfortunately. But, if everything goes well next week I'll be able to get Grapple Guys ready to go!

###Other Work

Progress on the website has skyrocketed! All the core features are implemented. I spent this week polishing it, and trying to spruce it up (which is a lot harder than I originally thought). Next step is to officially launch it, which I can hopefully get done this week!

###Free Time (Procrastination)

Been working on my draft skills for Eternal and managed to get my second 5-3 placement (go me). I have finally learned how to git gud at Dark Souls 3 after many stressful invasions in Irithyll.

Anyway, that's it for this week. For more regular updates you can find me on Twitter. Alternatively if you just want Grapple Guys/Two Week Challenge content I try to post regular updates to YouTube. In the mean time, stay tuned for next week where I'll hopefully have some interesting updates to share with you guys!
