### RPG Content Design
The following is an assortment of content design I've done for tabletop RPGs. There's a large backlog of content that I'm slowly adding to this portfolio. All of it can be found [over on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwg2FcBAt_-7bXNxa1lxc2ZRMXc?usp=sharing)

### Style On 'Em
Style On 'Em is a turn-based fighting game created for the [#makeitSUPERHOT game jam](http://www.moddb.com/games/style-on-em). Style On 'Em is a game that rewards flashy combos. Players are awarded points depending on how stylish their combos are; the player with the most points wins, not the last player standing. You can also check the game out on [itch.io](https://ariimoose.itch.io/style-on-em)

This was a solo project, and free third-party assets were used for the animations and sound effects.

### What Makes A Monster
A last minute entry to Itch.io's Bite-Sized Horror game jam in 2016. What Makes A Monster is a short attempt at horror using Twine, and can be found [here](https://ariimoose.itch.io/what-makes-a-monster). This game, along with other entries in the game jam were covered by [Jupi over at her YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rerOewfTKnk&feature=youtu.be)

### Grapple Guys

A simple 2D brawler with a gimmick. In Grapple Guys players attempt to stomp on one another's heads with the use of grappling hooks! This is being developed as part of my Two Week Challenge, where I try to develop a game in 14 days. You can see my progress on my [blog](https://ariimoose.github.io/), and over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-LX3iknXZp5djP7SACbGHA1dGJvhFg-x). Still not finished, but I'm halfway there!

### Holdout

Holdout is a game for Android devices that combines RTS & Tower Defense. At the time of writing Holdout is yet to be released, but my work on the game has concluded. Here's a link to the public test build we launched to gain feedback on controls & performance. The game changed a lot between this version, and the version that I concluded my work with.

### Tall Tales

Tall Tales was a game engine prototype I developed as part of my college dissertation. It aimed to merge natural-language processing (NLP) mechanics directly into a game engine using knowledge engines. The project was planned, designed & developed in ~7 months and didn't quite meet my expectations. This was due to me combining three very complicated topics into a project on a tight deadline. I did, however, get an amazing excuse to learn NLP outside of my college curriculum. Once again, the project is [over at my Github](https://github.com/AriiMoose/Tall-Tales). There's even a [short demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsKD6g6Sw58) on YouTube which has a surprising number of views. And if you're super curious you can [check out the dissertation](https://www.docdroid.net/VA2FWaD/andrewtullyfyp.pdf.html) on DocDroid

### BGE

BGE is a game engine developed by my Game Engines lecturer, Bryan Duggen, which he used as a teaching tool. We spent a full semester studying the engine, and developing with it as a learning exercise. This concluded with use making physics-driven automotans powered by BulletPhysics & OpenGL. [Here](https://youtu.be/ii049d7UFrg?t=5m54s) is a quick video demo of what was meant to be a Tripod from War of the Worlds. The fork of the repository can be found [here on my Github](https://github.com/AriiMoose/BGE) with README explaining the thought process behind the project

### Unity Flocking Simulation

A college assignment where we had to recreate a famous sci-fi battle of our choice using [flocking & steering AI](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/projects/pandai/aitypes.html), complete with camera angles and everything! I chose the [Battle for the Citadel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNnd6oUEQ2I) at the end of Mass Effect (spoilers?). The project can be found [on my Github](https://github.com/AriiMoose/Unity-Assignment-Sci-Fi-Battle) as per usual.

### Excalibur Quest (Prototype)

A prototype I developed for a freelance client. The game merges an adventure game with card-based mechanics. The game has not been developed further than this prototype, and as a result I have no material to show to the public
