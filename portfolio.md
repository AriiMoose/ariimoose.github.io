### Tabletop Design
The following is an assortment of design I've done for tabletop RPGs. This includes designing encounters and obstacles that are balanced, challenging and interesting, designing and playtesting new rules & systems, and creating/designing/writing coherent adventures that present the players with correctly balanced encounters and a central theme/objective.

The majority of this work uses the Symbaroum RPG system for the backbone. Additionally, there are some pieces of work that use Pathfinder and Fragged Empire RPG systems. There's a large backlog of content that I'm slowly adding to this portfolio. All of it can be found [over on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwg2FcBAt_-7bXNxa1lxc2ZRMXc?usp=sharing)

### Style On 'Em (C#, Unity)
Style On 'Em is a turn-based fighting game created for the [#makeitSUPERHOT game jam](http://www.moddb.com/games/style-on-em). Style On 'Em is a game that rewards flashy combos. Players are awarded points depending on how stylish their combos are; the player with the most points wins, not the last player standing. You can also check the game out on [itch.io](https://ariimoose.itch.io/style-on-em)

This was a solo project, and free third-party assets were used for the animations and sound effects. For this project I worked on integrating all sound assets and animations, as well as designing and developing the gameplay systems; simultaneous turns, player input, attacking/blocking/dodging. By using delegate events I tied player actions to their respective animations and outcomes.

### Grapple Guys (C#, Unity)

A simple 2D brawler with a gimmick. In Grapple Guys players attempt to stomp on one another's heads with the use of grappling hooks! This is being developed as part of my Two Week Challenge, where I try to develop a game in 14 days. The finished prototype can be found [over at itch.io](https://ariimoose.itch.io/grapple-guys)!

For this project I relied on honing old skills, while learning new ones. The biggest hurdle for this project was delving into pixel art as a complete novice, as well as improving my UI Development skills. This project implemented some very basic gameplay logic, and applied very simple game rules. The most interesting part of the development was the game's centerpiece; the grappling hook. To develop this I used a third-party solution as a tutorial/starting point to better understand the mechanics. After that I modified the solution, working heavily with raycasts and the creation of joints to simulate the physics of the grappling hook's rope.

### Holdout (C#, Unity)

Holdout is a game for Android devices that combines RTS & Tower Defense. At the time of writing Holdout is yet to be released, but my work on the game has concluded. Here's a link to the public test build we launched to gain feedback on controls & performance. The game changed a lot between this version, and the version that I concluded my work with.

### Tall Tales (Python, Natural Language Toolkit, Pyke, PyGame)

Tall Tales was a game engine prototype I developed as part of my college dissertation. It aimed to merge natural-language processing (NLP) mechanics directly into a game engine using knowledge engines. The project was planned, designed & developed in ~7 months and didn't quite meet my expectations. This was due to me combining three very complicated topics into a project on a tight deadline. I did, however, get an amazing excuse to learn NLP outside of my college curriculum. Once again, the project is [over at my Github](https://github.com/AriiMoose/Tall-Tales). There's even a [short demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsKD6g6Sw58) on YouTube which has a surprising number of views. And if you're super curious you can [check out the dissertation](https://www.docdroid.net/VA2FWaD/andrewtullyfyp.pdf.html) on DocDroid

### What Makes A Monster (Twine)
A last minute entry to Itch.io's Bite-Sized Horror game jam in 2016. What Makes A Monster is a short attempt at horror using Twine, and can be found [here](https://ariimoose.itch.io/what-makes-a-monster). This game, along with other entries in the game jam were covered by a small YouTuber by the name of Jupi. Unfortunately, this project didn't turn out as well as I would have liked. There are some spelling errors, and errors with the flow of scenes which could have been avoided by beginning work earlier.

### BGE (C++, OpenGL, BulletPhysics)

BGE is a game engine developed by my Game Engines lecturer, Bryan Duggen, which he used as a teaching tool. We spent a full semester studying the engine, and developing with it as a learning exercise. This concluded with use making physics-driven automotans powered by BulletPhysics & OpenGL. [Here](https://youtu.be/ii049d7UFrg?t=5m54s) is a quick video demo of what was meant to be a Tripod from War of the Worlds. The fork of the repository can be found [here on my Github](https://github.com/AriiMoose/BGE) with README explaining the thought process behind the project

### Unity Flocking Simulation (C#, Unity)

A college assignment where we had to recreate a famous sci-fi battle of our choice using [flocking & steering AI](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/projects/pandai/aitypes.html), complete with camera angles and everything! I chose the [Battle for the Citadel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNnd6oUEQ2I) at the end of Mass Effect (spoilers?). The project can be found [on my Github](https://github.com/AriiMoose/Unity-Assignment-Sci-Fi-Battle) as per usual.

### Excalibur Quest Prototype (C#, SQLite, Unity)

A prototype I developed for a freelance client. The game merges an adventure game with card-based mechanics. The game has not been developed further than this prototype, and as a result I have no material to show to the public
